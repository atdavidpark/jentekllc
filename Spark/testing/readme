To test Spark streaming application, especially socket streaming, it is helpful to have an in house automatic streaming generator, that 
can be customized to generate needed streaming data for funtionality testing using Spark streaming or any streaming.

1. Server:

sock_server.py

Socket server in Python, that generates endless random CSV lines in the format   datetime, random text string, random integer

Syntax:

python3 sock_server.py <port number>

No need to specify hostname or IP address, sock_server.py will listen to the port on all interfaces

2. Client (to make sure server is sending out streaming data before connecting your Spark streaming apps to the server)

socket_client.cpp
socket_client_util.c

Client test program is written in c++ and c, used to sanity test sock_server.py if it is modified.  It will just print whatever 
socket server sends out

Following is how to build:
gcc -fPIC -c socket_client_util.c -o socket_client_util.o
g++ -D HAVE_LONG_INT_64  socket_client.cpp socket_client_util.o -o sock_client

Syntax:
./sock_client <host name or IP address> <port>

Example:

Starting sock_server.py

python sock_server.py 29999
29999
Socket created
Socket bind complete
Listening on 29999
Connected with 10.0.0.46:48838
Client disconnect


Starting sock_client

./sock_client localhost 29999
localhost
127.0.0.1
ipaddress 127.0.0.1
port 29999
because but will not than do what take as do a look my just he for day the on well
